## 2026-10-03: Passionate Learning becomes one app (app v1.0 → v1.1)

The separate suite sites merge into one installable app at https://passionate-learning.vercel.app (`app/`).
- One profile across every world: XP, ranks E to S, days played (no streak reset), FSRS spaced repetition,
  Kumon-style mastery gates, a daily quest, arcade tokens.
- 9 live worlds, 163 cards, 6 card types; 4 worlds coming soon and open for contributors.
- AI for Idiots stickman look (hand-coded SVG), original System windows, stickman meme cards.
- What's Poppin bundled as the arcade break. PWA: installable, offline.
- Gauntlet loop: a blind critic judged the live app against Duolingo and Brilliant; v1.1 fixed one gap per screen
  (timer + speed bonus, answer juice, world path, recap that leads with the win, full-screen arcade).
- Repo renamed passion-learning-suite → passionate-learning; README, CONTRIBUTING, issue templates, Discussions.

## [0.27.2] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **LICENSE (MIT)** — the README had claimed MIT since the first commit but the repository shipped no LICENSE file, so GitHub reported no licence and nobody could legally reuse the template that is this repository's whole purpose. Copyright line matches the sibling repos.

### Fixed
- **Repo column in the games table** said "in this suite" for six games. No game source is tracked here: the tree is `template/`, `specs/`, `MASTER_SPEC.md` and `docs/`. Now reads "source not published", which is what row 7 already said.
- **Deployment line** claimed 10 live games against the 7 this README documents. Corrected to 7; all 7 Play links return 200.
- **738-test figure** was correct but buried inside a single thousand-word bullet. It now leads the bullet with the command that reproduces it, and the enumeration moved into a collapsed block.

## [0.27.1] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **35 autoSelectCore unit tests** (703→738 total) — `autoSelectCore-unit.test.ts` providing first direct unit test coverage for all 6 exported `autoSelectCore.ts` functions that were previously only tested indirectly through `planSession()` integration tests. `allocateSlots` (zero session size, fractional floor rounding, reviewRatio extremes 0/1.0, weakCategoryBoost 1.0 converting all new slots), `classifyReviewReason` (FSRS-first timestamp precedence over scoreLastSeen, exact 7-day boundary returns recall-bonus via `>=`, both-zero fallback producing `daysSince=0` → review, 365-day recall-bonus), `sortByWeakPriority` (unseen-before-seen ordering, oldest-seen-first among seen items, stable sort preserving order for tied unseen items, empty array, immutability — original array not mutated), `countByReason` (mixed 5-item tally, empty array all-zero baseline, single-reason-only accumulation), `findDominantReason` (clear winner, all-zero counts still returning valid reason without crash, 4-way tie determinism verified via double-call equality, single non-zero reason), `estimateDuration` (fractional ceiling rounding, exact whole number passthrough, zero items, zero minutesPerItem, sub-minute single item rounding to 1, large session correctness). Constants (`MS_PER_DAY`, `RECALL_BONUS_THRESHOLD_DAYS`, `WEAK_CATEGORY_THRESHOLD`) verified.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Mastery Milestone Predictor** (`lib/masteryMilestones.ts`) — Forward-looking engine that projects per-category mastery completion timelines. Addresses MASTER_SPEC "time-to-mastery" learning analytics. Computes `isItemMastered()` using dual-threshold check (≥80% accuracy AND ≥3 attempts, preventing single-correct flukes), `classifyStatus()` mapping mastery percent to 5-tier status ladder (locked → emerging → progressing → near-mastery → mastered), `projectSessions()` estimating remaining sessions from current velocity (sentinel -1 for unprojectable), `computeCategoryMilestones()` grouping items by category with mastery counts and status classification, and `buildMilestoneReport()` producing the full projection: per-category milestones with ETAs, overall completion percentage, next-closest milestone to reach, and total sessions to master everything. Pure functions — zero storage access, zero side effects. Composes with existing `learningVelocity` (mastery rate input) and `insights` (category strength data).
- **33 new tests** (670→703 total) — `masteryMilestones.test.ts` covering: `isItemMastered` (undefined score, below-minimum attempts, ratio boundary at 0.8, perfect scores, zero-correct, exact MIN_ATTEMPTS_FOR_MASTERY boundary), `classifyStatus` (all 5 tiers including boundary values 0/1/30/31/70/71/99/100, negative input), `projectSessions` (zero remaining, zero/negative/NaN/Infinity mastery rate, ceiling rounding, exact division, fractional rate), `computeCategoryMilestones` (empty items, single-category mastery counting, no-score items as unmastered, descending sort by mastery percent, multi-category grouping), `buildMilestoneReport` (overall progress aggregation, next milestone identification as closest-to-complete, null nextMilestone when all mastered, session estimate projection, -1 estimates at zero rate, empty curriculum graceful handling, constant sanity checks).

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Study Cadence Analyzer** (`lib/studyCadence.ts`) — Research-backed session timing analysis that answers "when should I study next?" Computes sessions-per-week frequency against the optimal 3-5/week range (cited in MASTER_SPEC from peer-reviewed meta-analysis), scores regularity via coefficient of variation (0-100 scale detecting bursty vs evenly-spaced patterns), recommends next study time using gap-based scheduling, and classifies cadence as optimal/under-practicing/over-practicing/irregular/new. Reuses `learningVelocity`'s existing `SessionSnapshot` storage — zero new localStorage keys. Pure functions: `computeGaps()` (inter-session gap extraction), `scoreRegularity()` (CV-based evenness scoring), `computeWeeklyRate()` (actual-span frequency), `recommendNextTime()` (adaptive gap targeting), `classifyCadence()` (threshold classification), `analyzeCadence()` (full report builder). Exports research constants `OPTIMAL_MIN_WEEKLY` (3) and `OPTIMAL_MAX_WEEKLY` (5).
- **37 new tests** (633→670 total) — `studyCadence.test.ts` covering: `computeGaps` (empty/single/multi timestamps, unsorted input, sub-day precision), `scoreRegularity` (empty/single/perfect/near-even/bursty/degenerate-zero gaps), `computeWeeklyRate` (empty/single/daily/every-other-day/same-day sessions), `recommendNextTime` (overdue→now, never-past, under-practicing gap shortening, over-practicing gap lengthening), `cadenceMessage` (all 5 rating messages), `classifyCadence` (all 5 ratings + boundary precision at 3/week and 5/week), `analyzeCadence` integration (zero sessions, well-spaced optimal, bursty irregular detection, non-negative hoursUntilNext, daysSinceLastSession accuracy).

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- **Auto-select core extraction** (`lib/autoSelectCore.ts`) — Extracted 6 pure utility functions from `sessionPlanner.ts` into a dedicated, storage-free module: `allocateSlots()` (phase slot computation), `classifyReviewReason()` (recall-bonus detection with FSRS-first timestamp authority), `sortByWeakPriority()` (unseen-first/oldest-seen ordering for weak-category selection), `countByReason()` (session item tallying), `findDominantReason()` (motivational messaging signal), and `estimateDuration()` (ceiling-rounded time estimate). Exports named constants `MS_PER_DAY`, `RECALL_BONUS_THRESHOLD_DAYS`, and `WEAK_CATEGORY_THRESHOLD` replacing magic numbers. `sessionPlanner.ts` now imports and delegates to these primitives — all 633 tests pass unchanged, confirming behavioral equivalence.

## [0.24.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **13 contract-invariant tests** (620→633 total) — `autoSelect-contract-invariants.test.ts` targeting previously untested structural contracts across the auto-select pipeline: phantom FSRS card filtering (due and upcoming items referencing items absent from catalog are silently skipped without crash), weak category 70% boundary precision (`accuracy < 70` correctly excludes exactly-70% categories while including 69%), output priority sort monotonicity (reviews→upcoming→weak→new ordering verified via non-decreasing priority assertion), `selectItems` implicit profile computation (omitting the profile argument triggers internal `analyzeDifficulty` call), `findWeakestItems` ratio-tie daysSinceReview tiebreaker (equal-ratio items sorted by most days since review first), `computeCategoryStrengths` zero-attempt score exclusion (items with `correct=0, incorrect=0` don't create phantom categories), `computeCategoryStrengths` descending accuracy sort order verification, `analyzeDifficulty` confidence level boundaries (0 attempts→"new", 1-4→"low", 5+→"high" matching WINDOW=5), and Phase 3 bypass verification (when Phases 1+2 fill all session slots, `remaining=0` prevents any new-content selection).

## [0.24.1] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **14 degenerate-input tests** (606→620 total) — `autoSelect-degenerate-inputs.test.ts` targeting untested edge conditions across the auto-select pipeline: single-slot sessions (`sessionSize: 1` with review vs new-only paths), review-only sessions (`reviewRatio: 1.0` starving Phases 2/3), due/upcoming overlap deduplication within Phase 1, multiple weak categories competing for limited slots, Phase 1 exhausting all weak-category items before Phase 2 runs (usedIds filtering), partial options merge preserving defaults (`minutesPerItem`-only override, no-options invocation), `describeSession` mixed-session grammar (all three parts joined, singular weak-area drill, singular new item), and `estimatedMinutes` ceiling rounding precision (fractional minutesPerItem × small item counts).

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Difficulty Pulse Engine** (`lib/difficultyPulse.ts`) — Pure-function display layer that transforms the adaptive difficulty engine's `DifficultyProfile` into player-facing data. Computes per-tier status classification (promoted/on-track/struggling/untested) using the 85% promote and 50% demote thresholds, maps confidence levels to player-readable labels (CALIBRATING/LEARNING YOU/LOCKED IN), generates ARIA descriptions for accessibility, and produces deterministic color mappings via the game's semantic token system. Zero side effects, injectable for testing.
- **Difficulty Pulse Component** (`components/game/DifficultyPulse.tsx`) — Metacognitive visualization that makes the invisible adaptive difficulty engine visible to players. Shows three-tier accuracy meter (easy/medium/hard) with animated fill bars, threshold markers at 50% (demote) and 85% (promote) boundaries, pulsing "ACTIVE" indicator on the recommended tier, confidence badge, and tier status icons (◇/◆/★). Integrated into PlayerInsights dashboard between Daily Challenge and Learning Velocity. WCAG 2.2 AA compliant (ARIA region, progressbar roles, description). Framer Motion animations matching codebase patterns. SSR-safe via `useEffect`.
- **24 new tests** (582→606 total) — `difficultyPulse.test.ts` covering: `buildDifficultyPulse` (tier ordering, untested new player state, recommended tier marking, promoted/on-track/struggling status classification, exact boundary precision at 85%/50%/49%, totalAttempts aggregation, confidence label mapping, ARIA description generation for empty and populated states, all-tiers-active simultaneous state, NaN preservation for untested tiers), `tierFillPercent` (NaN→0, negative clamping, overflow clamping, passthrough), `tierColor` (all 4 status→color mappings), `tierTextColor` (all 4 status→text-color mappings).

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Session History Engine** (`lib/sessionHistory.ts`) — Pure-function aggregation layer that transforms stored session snapshots into a displayable timeline with accuracy trends, relative day labels, and trend detection. Reuses existing `learningVelocity` snapshot storage (no new localStorage keys). Computes: average/best accuracy, trend direction (up/down/flat/new) via linear regression on recent sessions, and reverse-chronological entry list with formatted day/time labels (Today, Yesterday, day names, M/D format).
- **Session History Component** (`components/game/SessionHistory.tsx`) — Visual timeline showing recent sessions with per-session accuracy bars (color-coded: emerald ≥80%, amber ≥60%, rose <60%), SVG accuracy sparkline with endpoint dot, 3-stat summary bar (sessions/avg accuracy/best), and trend indicator. Stagger-animated with Framer Motion. Empty state for new players. SSR-safe via `useState` lazy initializer.
- **20 new tests** (562→582 total) — `sessionHistory.test.ts` covering: `toDayLabel` relative formatting (today/yesterday/day-name/M-D), `toTimeLabel` AM/PM formatting (morning/afternoon/midnight/noon), `buildSessionHistory` aggregation (total count, reverse chronological ordering, average/best accuracy, improving/declining/flat/new trend detection, entry limiting, empty state, accuracyTrend ordering, dayLabel/timeLabel population).

## [0.22.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **13 phase-boundary tests** (549→562 total) — `autoSelect-phase-boundaries.test.ts` targeting untested critical paths across the auto-select pipeline: disabled review phase (`reviewRatio: 0` still produces zero reviews despite due FSRS cards), disabled weak-category phase (`weakCategoryBoost: 0` skips Phase 2 entirely), Phase 2 starvation (boost=1.0 consumes all new-item slots, starving Phase 3), weak-category internal sort order (unseen items before oldest-seen), `describeSession` all-zero plan edge case (no crash, no undefined/NaN), singular review+bonus grammar, `computeCategoryStrengths` tie classification (`correct === incorrect` counts as weak via `>=` boundary), orphaned score filtering, `findWeakestItems` timestamp edges (daysSinceReview=0 for just-seen items, default limit=5), and `computeMasteryRate` defensive boundaries (mastered > seen returns >100%, large number precision).

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Daily Challenge Banner** (`components/game/DailyChallengeBanner.tsx`) — Player-facing engagement component that surfaces the date-seeded daily challenge engine as an interactive banner. Features: live midnight countdown timer (60s refresh), focus category display with separator-to-space formatting, animated bonus multiplier badge (1.5×–3× with breathing glow), item count, completion state with accuracy/time/XP results and perfect score detection with spring animation, "START CHALLENGE" CTA with callback. Empty catalog returns null (no empty state noise). WCAG 2.2 AA compliant (ARIA labels, region landmark). Framer Motion stagger animations matching codebase patterns.
- **PlayerInsights integration** — `DailyChallengeBanner` added at the top of the PlayerInsights dashboard (above Learning Pulse), with `onStartDailyChallenge` callback prop threaded through.
- **19 new tests** (530→549 total) — `dailyChallengeBanner.test.ts` covering: challenge generation data contract (non-empty items, empty catalog hiding, displayable category, multiplier bounds, future expiry), completed state rendering data (perfect accuracy detection, non-perfect exclusion, bonusXP engine calculation match, partial completion XP), countdown timer data (hours+minutes, minutes-only, expired, zero-minute boundary), category display formatting (underscores/dots/hyphens to spaces, empty-to-MIXED fallback), and single-item catalog edge cases (1-item generation, single-category focus).

## [0.21.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **13 critical-path edge-case tests** (517→530 total) — `autoSelect-critical-paths.test.ts` targeting untested boundaries across the auto-select pipeline: zero-timestamp FSRS `lastReview` guards (prevents false recall-bonus on never-reviewed cards), fractional slot rounding (`floor()` zeroing out review phase at low ratios), `reviewCount` arithmetic verification (review + recall-bonus sum correctness), `dominantReason` tie-breaking stability (valid reason selected when counts tie), `selectItems` oldest-seen ranking (correct ordering when all items have scores, unseen-always-first guarantee), `describeSession` weak-area-only and all-bonus sessions, and `analyzeDifficulty` single-item threshold precision at exact promote/demote boundaries (85%/84%/49%).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Recall Rewards Engine** (`lib/recallRewards.ts`) — Pure-function engine that surfaces the delayed-reward XP system as player-facing reward windows. Scans all item scores to identify: items currently in a 7-day (2×) or 30-day (3×) recall bonus window (claimable now), and items approaching the 7-day threshold within a configurable lookahead (upcoming). Computes total claimable XP. Tier-sorted output (3× before 2×), injectable timestamps for deterministic testing.
- **Recall Rewards Component** (`components/game/RecallRewards.tsx`) — Interactive tracker showing claimable and upcoming XP multiplier opportunities. Animated pulsing "CLAIM NOW" badges for eligible items, countdown days for upcoming windows, tier-colored reward badges (2×/3×), total claimable XP counter with breathing animation. Empty-state messaging for new players. WCAG 2.2 AA compliant (ARIA labels, region landmarks). Framer Motion stagger animations.
- **16 new tests** (501→517 total) — `recallRewards.test.ts` covering: empty scores, zero-attempt filtering, 7-day/30-day boundary precision (exact boundary + claimable detection), upcoming window lookahead (within/outside range, custom lookahead), tier sort order (3× before 2×), daysUntil ascending sort, claimableXP calculation (mixed tiers, custom baseXP), bulk performance (100 items), and `countRewards` aggregation.
- **PlayerInsights integration** — `RecallRewards` component added to the PlayerInsights dashboard between Learning Velocity and Category Strengths sections.

## [0.20.1] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **JSDoc coverage** — Added comprehensive documentation to all 10 interfaces and 1 type alias in `types/game.ts` (`ContentItem`, `Enrichment`, `Category`, `Level`, `GameState`, `UserProgress`, `ItemScore`, `GameResults`, `MasteryCheck`, `CategoryType`). Every field now has a JSDoc comment explaining its purpose, valid ranges, and how it connects to other systems (difficulty engine, session planner, FSRS scheduler). These are the foundational types every game inherits — previously zero documentation.
- **Session planner types** — Added JSDoc to `SessionItemReason`, `SessionItem`, and `SessionPlan` in `sessionPlanner.ts`. Reason type now documents all 4 variants with behavioral notes (XP multipliers, accuracy thresholds). `SessionPlan` fields document their computation sources.
- **README architecture section** — Added "Auto-Select Architecture" section with ASCII data-flow diagram showing how `useSessionPlanner` → `planSession` → FSRS/insights/difficulty engine → storage layer connect. Documents the 3-phase planning algorithm, priority ordering, deduplication strategy, and key design decisions (why reviews come first, how recall bonuses motivate, why weak categories get dedicated slots).

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Knowledge Decay Panel** (`components/game/KnowledgeDecayPanel.tsx`) — Interactive FSRS-powered knowledge health dashboard that surfaces the decay predictor engine as a player-facing visualization. Features: animated SVG health ring (0-100 score with spring physics and neon glow), 5-horizon selector (1/3/7/14/30 days), per-category risk breakdown with urgency badges (critical/warning/stable), scrollable at-risk item list with color-coded retention dots and days-until-threshold countdowns. Empty-state messaging for new players. Connects directly to `knowledgeDecay.ts` engine built in v0.19.0. WCAG 2.2 AA compliant (ARIA labels, keyboard-accessible horizon buttons, `aria-pressed` states). Framer Motion stagger animations.
- **12 new tests** (489→501 total) — `knowledgeDecayPanel.test.ts` covering panel data pipeline: empty state (no cards, unreviewed cards), health scoring (healthy cards → high score, decayed cards → low score, bounded 0-100 across all horizons), horizon switching (monotonic risk growth, valid forecasts for all standard horizons), category risk aggregation (correct grouping, critical/warning urgency thresholds), and at-risk item ordering (urgency sort, integer retention bounds).

## [0.19.1] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **19 critical-path edge-case tests** (470→489 total) — Targets untested boundaries across three recently added modules: `knowledgeDecay` (future `lastReview` timestamps, custom `retentionTarget` boundaries, 100% decay health-score-zero scenario, Infinity guard behavior for both elapsed and stability, extremely stable card across all horizons), `learningVelocity` (`linearSlope` with empty/two-point/identical arrays, `recordSession` negative-itemsSeen rejection, zero-mastery velocity computation, varying itemsSeen density ratio), and `achievementNotifier` (manual dismiss resetting auto-dismiss timer chain, enqueue-during-auto-dismiss interleaving, duplicate achievement ID independence, full subscriber lifecycle state transitions).

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Knowledge Decay Predictor** (`lib/knowledgeDecay.ts`) — Forward-looking engine that uses FSRS card stability to predict which items will drop below the 90% retention threshold and when. Computes per-item retrievability via the forgetting curve `R = e^(-t/S)`, solves for exact days-until-threshold breach, and groups at-risk items across 5 forecast horizons (1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days). Produces per-category risk scores (critical/warning/stable) and an overall knowledge health score (0-100). Pure functions, no side effects, injectable timestamps for testing.
- **23 new tests** (447→470 total) — Covers `retrievability` (boundary values, NaN/negative/zero stability, decay monotonicity), `daysUntilDecay` (mathematical inverse verification, edge cases), `predictDecay` (at-risk identification, zero-rep skip, urgency sort order, category aggregation, critical threshold, health score, orphan items), and `fullDecayForecast` (horizon completeness, monotonic risk growth, empty input).

## [0.18.5] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **README API coverage** — Added missing API reference tables for 3 lib modules that had prose descriptions but no structured function tables: `retentionCurve.ts` (6 functions: `ebbinghaus`, `bucketByInterval`, `findNearestBucket`, `computeRetentionCurve`, `retentionToSVG`, `pointsToPath`), `learningVelocity.ts` (4 functions: `getSessionSnapshots`, `recordSession`, `linearSlope`, `computeVelocity`), and `achievementNotifier.ts` (6 functions: `enqueue`, `dismiss`, `peek`, `pending`, `clear`, `subscribe`).
- **Game Components table** — Added 4 missing components: `LearningVelocity`, `RetentionCurve`, `AchievementToast`, `SessionForecast`. All existed in the codebase but were described only in prose bullets, not in the structured props/description table developers ctrl+F for.

## [0.18.4] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Auto-select integration tests** (`__tests__/autoSelect-integration.test.ts`) — 16 new tests (431→447 total) covering untested critical paths in the adaptive difficulty engine and session planner composition. Tests include: `computeRecommendation` cascade when hard<50% with medium data present (3 branches), recall-bonus 7-day boundary precision (exact boundary, just-under, FSRS vs itemScores divergence), `selectItems` boundary inputs (count=0, count>catalog, empty catalog), same-millisecond timestamp sort stability, catalog exhaustion (sessionSize > available items, estimated minutes accuracy), `hasReviewsDue` (due/empty/future-only), and three-phase deduplication under catalog pressure (item eligible for review + weak-category + new simultaneously).

## [0.18.1] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Achievement notification service** (`lib/achievementNotifier.ts`) — Extracted notification/display logic from the achievement system into a dedicated FIFO queue service. Manages sequential display of simultaneous unlocks with auto-dismiss (4s), sound integration (`playAchievement()` per toast), and a pub/sub API (`subscribe`/`enqueue`/`dismiss`/`clear`). Framework-agnostic core, consumed via `useSyncExternalStore` in the new `AchievementToastConnected` component which also shows a `+N` badge when multiple achievements are queued. Original `AchievementToast` preserved for backward compatibility.
- **14 new tests** (417→431 total) — Covers enqueue (empty array rejection, single/batch queuing, sound-on-first-only), dismiss (queue advancement, empty-queue safety), auto-dismiss (4s timer, full queue drain), subscribe (enqueue/empty/unsubscribe notifications), and clear (flush + subscriber notification).

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Learning Velocity engine** (`lib/learningVelocity.ts`) — Session-over-session performance tracking that answers "am I learning faster or just grinding?" Records per-session snapshots (items seen, accuracy, mastery conversions) to localStorage, computes mastery velocity (mastered/seen ratio), and derives trend direction via least-squares linear regression over the last 30 sessions. Four trend states: accelerating, decelerating, cruising, warming up. SSR-safe, pure functions, capped at 30 snapshots with malformed-entry filtering.
- **`LearningVelocity` component** (`components/game/LearningVelocity.tsx`) — SVG sparkline visualization showing accuracy trend across sessions with neon glow, endpoint dot, trend indicator badge (▲ ACCELERATING / ▼ DECELERATING / ● CRUISING / ◌ WARMING UP), and three stat cells (this session mastery %, average mastery %, session count). Integrated into `PlayerInsights` dashboard. ARIA-labeled, Framer Motion animated.
- **16 new tests** (401→417 total) — Covers `linearSlope` (positive/negative/flat/noisy), session storage (record/retrieve, empty-session rejection, 30-cap trimming, malformed JSON recovery, invalid entry filtering), and `computeVelocity` (insufficient data, improving/declining/steady trends, average/current velocity math).

## [0.17.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Recall-bonus detection** (`sessionPlanner.ts:planSession`) — Recall-bonus tagging (7+ day = 2× XP) now uses the FSRS card's `lastReview` timestamp as the authoritative source, falling back to `itemScores.lastSeen` only when no card exists. Previously used `itemScores.lastSeen` exclusively, which silently dropped recall bonuses when `gradeItem()` ran without a corresponding `updateItemScore()` call — the two storage paths can diverge, causing players to miss earned XP multipliers.
- **2 new tests** (399→401 total) — Covers FSRS-only recall bonus detection (no `itemScores` entry) and FSRS `lastReview` taking precedence over stale `itemScores.lastSeen`.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- **JSDoc coverage** — Added documentation to 6 undocumented public functions across `soundEngine.ts` (`loadSoundPrefs`, `saveSoundPrefs`), `achievements.ts` (`getUnlocked`), and `activityHeatmap.ts` (`toDateKey`, `countToIntensity`, `computeStreaks`). Each JSDoc includes parameter descriptions, return types, and behavioral notes (SSR safety, validation, thresholds).
- **README accuracy** — Fixed stale test count (420→399) and added `useCombo` hook + `ComboMeter` component to their respective API tables. Added missing API reference tables for Sound Engine (7 functions) and Activity Heatmap (4 functions), matching the documentation pattern used by other modules.
- **Repo structure** — Added `useCombo` to the hooks directory listing.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Combo system** (`hooks/useCombo.ts`) — In-session consecutive-correct-answer multiplier with 4 escalating tiers: warm (3+ = 2× XP), hot (5+ = 3×), fire (8+ = 4×), ultra (12+ = 5×). 8-second inactivity decay timer (configurable). Peak tracking per session. Callbacks for tier-up and combo-break events. Wrong answer resets immediately. Designed to stack with existing recall multipliers (combo × recall = up to 15× XP).
- **`ComboMeter` component** (`components/game/ComboMeter.tsx`) — Spring-animated HUD element showing live combo count, multiplier badge, and tier label. Tier-specific neon colors (warning → accent → secondary → error) with escalating glow intensity. ARIA live region for screen reader announcements. Framer Motion entrance/exit with spring physics. Appears at 2+ combo, positioned top-center (overridable via className).
- **21 new tests** (378→399 total) — `combo.test.ts` covering: tier resolution at every boundary (0–100), multiplier scaling (1×/2×/3×/4×/5×), sequential tier transitions, boundary-1 values, negative count safety, peak tracking across multiple combo breaks, decay timer firing/cancellation/custom duration (fake timers), and XP integration math including combo × recall stacking.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **23 new edge-case tests** (355→378 total) — `edgeCases.test.ts` covering critical untested security and corruption recovery paths:
  - **Write-path prototype pollution rejection**: `completeLevel`, `updateItemScore`, `saveFSRSCard`, `getRecallMultiplier`, `recordMasteryAttempt` all reject `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` IDs silently without corrupting state
  - **itemScores corruption recovery**: non-object score values stripped, NaN/undefined numeric fields clamped to 0, `completedLevels` entries exceeding 128 chars filtered out
  - **checkMastery hardening**: non-object stored mastery data returns false, attempts with NaN/Infinity accuracy filtered as invalid
  - **Daily challenge corruption**: `isDailyChallengeComplete` and `getDailyChallengeResult` gracefully recover from malformed JSON and expired results
  - **memoryTier boundary precision**: color token assertions (success/warning/error/accent) for all 4 tiers, boundary value tests at 74→BUILDING and 39→FRAGILE thresholds

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **`SessionForecast` component** (`components/session/SessionForecast.tsx`) — Pre-session overview screen that visualizes the auto-select brain's plan before gameplay begins. Shows a stacked composition bar (review/bonus/weak/new segments with animated fill), a scrollable item queue with per-item reason tags and prompt previews (truncated at 50 chars), recall bonus XP callout for 7+ day items, estimated session time, and a "BEGIN SESSION" CTA. Empty-state messaging ("ALL CAUGHT UP") when no items are due. Staggered Framer Motion entrance with cascading `fadeUp` reveals. Matches the CRT/neon design system with `pixel-border`, `neon-glow`, and `font-pixel` tokens. Builds metacognitive awareness by explaining *why* each item was selected — research shows learners who understand their study plan retain 20-30% more.
- **10 new tests** (345→355 total) — `sessionForecast.test.ts` covering: empty plan zero-state, composition count summation (review+bonus+weak+new = total items), recall-bonus reason tagging, percentage calculation for composition segments, prompt truncation at 50 chars with ellipsis, single-item session handling, reason type uniqueness (4 distinct identifiers), dominant reason validation, estimated minutes positivity, and priority ordering (lower = more urgent).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Sound engine** (`lib/soundEngine.ts`) — Web Audio API synthesized game sounds with zero external audio files. 5 distinct sound cues mapped to game events: `playCorrect()` (ascending C-E-G chime), `playIncorrect()` (soft descending Eb-C triangle wave — NOT a buzzer), `playCelebration()` (major chord burst + rising arpeggio to C6), `playAchievement()` (shimmering A-C#-E-A-C# rise), `playTick()` (subtle UI interaction). All sounds use exponential gain decay for natural instrument-like fade. Volume and mute preferences persisted to localStorage with validation (range clamping, type checking, malformed JSON recovery). SSR-safe with `typeof window` guards. Lazy AudioContext initialization with suspended-state resume.
- **`SoundControl` component** (`components/ui/SoundControl.tsx`) — Floating sound control widget with mute toggle button (context-aware emoji: muted/low/high) and volume slider. Framer Motion entrance animation. Full keyboard accessibility with focus-visible ring. Backdrop blur glass effect matching the CRT design system.
- **17 new tests** (328→345 total) — `soundEngine.test.ts` covering: default preference loading, saved preference retrieval, malformed JSON recovery, out-of-range volume rejection (>1, <0), non-boolean muted rejection, missing field graceful defaults, preference persistence and overwrite, oscillator count verification per sound (3 correct, 2 incorrect, 7 celebration, 1 tick, 5 achievement), mute gating (no oscillators created when muted), volume multiplier scaling on gain nodes. Web Audio API mocked via function constructor pattern.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **`dailyChallenge` lib** (`lib/dailyChallenge.ts`) — Deterministic daily challenge engine that generates the same challenge for all players on a given day. Uses date-seeded PRNG (djb2 hash + mulberry32) for reproducible item selection, rotating focus categories daily. Features: streak-aware bonus multiplier (1.5× base, +0.5× per 5 streak days, max 3×), perfect accuracy bonus (+25 XP), expiry countdown formatter, and localStorage persistence for completion tracking. Challenge items are weighted 3:2 toward the day's focus category for themed learning sessions.
- **25 new tests** (281→306 total) — `dailyChallenge.test.ts` covering: deterministic seeding (same date = same items), challenge size (default 5, custom, edge cases), focus category validation and rotation, expiry timestamp, streak-based multiplier calculation, empty/undersized catalog handling, no-duplicate guarantee, bonus XP calculation (base × multiplier, perfect bonus, zero cases, rounding), time-until-expiry formatting (hours+minutes, minutes-only, expired), localStorage persistence (save/retrieve/yesterday-expiry/incomplete-state), date key format validation.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **`RetentionCurve` component** (`components/game/RetentionCurve.tsx`) — Animated SVG visualization of the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve overlaid with the player's actual retention data. Features: theoretical decay line (dashed, amber), actual retention curve (solid, neon glow), color-coded data points (green = beating the curve, red = below), hover tooltips showing retention % and review count, gradient fill under actual curve, stat pills (overall retention, total reviews, 7-day recall), responsive legend, and empty-state messaging. Reads events across all game namespaces. Spring-animated entrance via Framer Motion.
- **`retentionCurve` lib** (`lib/retentionCurve.ts`) — Pure functions: `ebbinghaus(day, stability)` computes theoretical retention via R=e^(-t/S), `findNearestBucket(days)` maps review intervals to measurement buckets with adaptive thresholds, `bucketByInterval(events)` aggregates learning events into day-interval retention rates, `computeRetentionCurve(events)` produces full curve data with theoretical + actual points, `retentionToSVG(day, retention, w, h, pad)` maps data to SVG coordinates, `pointsToPath(coords)` generates smooth cubic bezier SVG paths.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Adaptive Difficulty Engine documentation** (`docs/adaptive-difficulty.md`) — Dedicated deep-dive covering the Kumon-style tier-ladder algorithm, tuning constants (`WINDOW=5`, `PROMOTE_THRESHOLD=85%`, `DEMOTE_THRESHOLD=50%`), confidence levels, growth-mindset-biased tier fallback order, `useDifficulty` hook integration guide, and session planner interaction diagram. The engine drives all 10 games but previously had only a 2-row API table in the README.

### Changed
- **README: Adaptive Difficulty section** — Expanded from bare function signatures to include promotion/demotion thresholds, confidence levels, fallback bias explanation, and a link to the full documentation. Added `docs/` directory to repo structure tree.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **`CategoryRadar` component** (`components/game/CategoryRadar.tsx`) — SVG radar chart visualizing category mastery as a neon polygon. Features: concentric ring grid (25/50/75/100%), axis lines per category, animated polygon fill with glow filter, spring-animated data point dots, color-coded category labels (green ≥70%, yellow ≥40%, red <40%), center average accuracy readout, and full ARIA labeling. Requires 3+ categories to render.
- **`categoryRadar` lib** (`lib/categoryRadar.ts`) — Pure geometry functions: `polarToCartesian(angle, radius, cx, cy)` converts polar→cartesian with 12-o'clock origin, `computeRadarPoints(strengths, radius, cx, cy)` maps category accuracies to polygon vertices, `pointsToPolygon(pts)` generates SVG polygon strings, `computeAxisEndpoints(count, radius, cx, cy)` generates grid axis coordinates.
- **16 new tests** (235→251 total) — `categoryRadar.test.ts` covering: `polarToCartesian` cardinal directions (0°/90°/180°/270°) + zero-radius center, `computeRadarPoints` minimum-3 threshold, 100%/0% accuracy extremes, label/value preservation, 4-category 90° distribution, `pointsToPolygon` formatting + empty array, `computeAxisEndpoints` minimum-3 guard + count + top-origin.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **`ActivityHeatmap` component** (`components/game/ActivityHeatmap.tsx`) — GitHub-style pixel-art activity calendar showing daily learning events over 12 weeks. Features: logarithmic intensity scaling (5 levels from empty to max), hover tooltips with event count and date, spring-animated cell zoom on hover, stat pills showing active days/current streak/best streak, and intensity legend. Reads events across all game namespaces for suite-wide activity tracking.
- **`activityHeatmap` lib** (`lib/activityHeatmap.ts`) — Pure functions: `buildHeatmap(events, weeks)` aggregates `LearningEvent[]` into a `HeatmapData` grid with per-day counts, intensity levels, and streak computation. `toDateKey()` for timestamp→date conversion, `countToIntensity()` for logarithmic bucketing, `computeStreaks()` for current/best streak calculation from date sets.
- **18 new tests** (217→235 total) — `activityHeatmap.test.ts` covering: `toDateKey` formatting + padding, `countToIntensity` all 5 threshold boundaries, `computeStreaks` empty/single/consecutive/gap/historical scenarios, `buildHeatmap` day count, all-zero baseline, event aggregation, window exclusion, intensity mapping, and streak derivation.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- **Refactor: SessionBanner extracted to `session/` directory** — Moved `SessionBanner` from `components/game/` to `components/session/` to group session-related UI components together. No API or behavior changes.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **JSDoc enrichment** — Added full `@param`, `@returns`, and `@example` blocks to `getRecapMessage()` and `memoryTier()` in `sessionRecapMessages.ts`. Both functions now show realistic return values in IDE hover previews.
- **README: Session Recap Messages API** — New reference table documenting `getRecapMessage()` and `memoryTier()` with tier thresholds (Strong ≥ 75, Building ≥ 40, Fragile > 0, New = 0).
- **README: Components reference** — Added props tables for all 10 components (4 UI + 6 game), including `VictoryScreen` `speedLabel` regex behavior and `SessionRecap` prop surface. Components were previously undiscoverable without reading source.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **`SessionRecap` component** (`components/game/SessionRecap.tsx`) — Post-session debrief screen shown when a session completes. Surfaces: session breakdown by reason type (reinforced/bonus recall/drilled/discovered) with per-reason counts, animated memory strength meter with tier labels (Strong/Building/Fragile/New) powered by FSRS stability data via `computeMemoryStrength()`, contextual motivational messages that adapt to session composition (review-dominant, weak-category drill, new content, recall-bonus heavy), and action buttons for starting a new session or viewing insights. Staggered Framer Motion entrance animations with spring physics on the header.
- **`sessionRecapMessages` lib** (`lib/sessionRecapMessages.ts`) — Pure functions extracted for testability: `getRecapMessage(plan)` selects motivational feedback based on dominant session reason and recall bonus count, `memoryTier(strength)` maps 0-100 memory strength to tier label + color tokens.
- **10 new tests** (207→217 total) — `sessionRecap.test.ts` covering: empty session message, review/weak-category/new/recall-bonus dominant messages, recall-bonus priority override (2+ bonuses), and `memoryTier` boundary thresholds (Strong≥75, Building≥40, Fragile>0, New=0).

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **11 new tests** (196→207 total) — `sessionPlanner-edge-cases.test.ts` covering: review queue fallback to upcoming items with priority validation, orphaned FSRS card references (deleted items silently skipped), extreme ratio edge cases (`reviewRatio: 0/1`, `weakCategoryBoost: 0`), multi-weak-category targeting across category boundaries, `describeSession` with all-zero/empty plans and full three-section ordering verification, three-phase integration test ensuring review→weak→new pipeline produces no duplicates and respects phase boundaries.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **27 new tests** (169→196 total) — `sessionPlanner.test.ts` covering: plan shape validation, session size/empty/small catalog handling, item deduplication, priority sorting, estimated minutes scaling, FSRS review slot filling, recall-bonus flagging (7+ day gap) vs recent items, weak-category targeting (<70% accuracy) with category verification, strong-category skip, dominant reason inference, `describeSession` singular/plural grammar for reviews/new items/drills + bonus XP notation + multi-part joining, `hasReviewsDue` with no cards/overdue/future-scheduled.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`useSessionPlanner` hook** (`hooks/useSessionPlanner.ts`) — React integration for the smart session planner. Wraps `planSession()` with sequential item consumption: `advance()` moves to the next item after answering, `skip()` passes, `replan()` rebuilds from scratch. Exposes `currentItem`, `currentReason` (review/weak-category/new/recall-bonus), `progress` (current/total), `description` (human-readable summary), and `isComplete`. Memoized initial plan from content catalog.
- **`SessionBanner` component** (`components/game/SessionBanner.tsx`) — Compact retro-styled session status banner for the top of game screens. Features: animated pixel progress bar, reason tag with contextual icons (review/bonus XP/weak area/new), composition pills showing session mix, animated transitions between reason states via AnimatePresence, and "SESSION COMPLETE" spring animation on finish.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Smart Session Planner** (`lib/sessionPlanner.ts`) — Auto-select orchestrator that builds optimal study sessions by combining three intelligence signals: (1) FSRS spaced repetition review queue (overdue items first, upcoming items second), (2) weak category targeting (items from categories below 70% accuracy), and (3) difficulty-matched new content via the adaptive difficulty engine. Items with 7+ day gaps are flagged as `recall-bonus` for XP motivation. Configurable session size, review ratio, and weak-category boost.
- `planSession(items, options?)` — Build a prioritized session plan with review/new/weak-category item mix, estimated duration, and dominant session type.
- `hasReviewsDue()` — Lightweight check for pending FSRS reviews (for badge/notification UI without full plan computation).
- `describeSession(plan)` — Human-readable session summary (e.g. `"4 reviews (2 bonus XP!) + 3 weak-area drills + 3 new items · ~8 min"`).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-26

### Security
- **`useSoundEffects` deserialization hardening** — `JSON.parse()` on localStorage was spread directly into state with zero validation. Added `validateSoundSettings()` with prototype pollution protection (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` stripped), strict boolean/number type enforcement, and volume clamping to [0, 1]. Previously a crafted `pl_sound_settings` payload could inject arbitrary keys or cause NaN propagation through Web Audio API (CWE-502, CWE-1321, OWASP A08).
- **Share text input sanitization** — `gameName` in `generateShareText()` and `navigator.share()` was passed through unsanitized. Added `sanitizeShareString()` which strips control characters (U+0000–U+001F, U+007F–U+009F), newlines (prevents fake content injection in share previews), and enforces 100-char length limit. Empty names fall back to "Game" (CWE-20, OWASP A03).
- **`currentCategory` validation tightened** — `validateProgress()` in `storage.ts` only enforced a 128-char length limit on `currentCategory` but didn't validate against `CONTENT_ID_PATTERN`. Now uses the same `isValidContentId()` check applied to all other content IDs, rejecting prototype pollution keys and non-whitelisted characters consistently (CWE-20).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Spaced Repetition Scheduler** (`lib/spacedRepetition.ts`) — Active scheduling engine that bridges ts-fsrs with the storage layer. `gradeItem()` creates/updates FSRS cards and computes optimal review intervals. `inferGrade()` maps correct/incorrect + confidence to FSRS quality grades (again/hard/good/easy). `getReviewQueue()` builds prioritized due/upcoming queues. `computeMemoryStrength()` scores overall memory retention 0-100 from average card stability. Fuzz enabled to prevent predictable review patterns.
- **19 new tests** (150→169 total) — `spacedRepetition.test.ts` covering: grade inference (5 cases), item grading with card creation/persistence/updates/interval ordering/difficulty bounds, review queue (empty/overdue/sort/upcoming/limit), memory strength (empty/full/capped/averaged).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Player Insights Engine** (`lib/insights.ts`) — Pure computation layer with `computeCategoryStrengths()` (per-category accuracy from item scores), `findWeakestItems()` (items with worst correct-to-total ratio, tie-broken by staleness), and `computeMasteryRate()` (mastery conversion percentage). Zero side effects, fully testable.
- **PlayerInsights Component** (`components/game/PlayerInsights.tsx`) — Retro-styled analytics dashboard showing: Learning Pulse overview (items seen, mastered, mastery rate, avg time-to-mastery), 7-day and 30-day retention recall bars with color-coded thresholds, per-category strength breakdown with animated Framer Motion progress bars, and a "Needs Work" section highlighting weakest items. Empty state handled gracefully. ARIA progressbar roles for accessibility.
- **15 new tests** (135→150 total) — `insights.test.ts` covering: category strength computation (empty scores, multi-category accuracy, sort order, zero-attempt exclusion), weakest item ranking (ratio sort, limit, staleness tie-breaking, days-since-review accuracy, zero-attempt exclusion), mastery rate (zero/full/partial/rounded/negative edge cases).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Social Share Cards** — retro-styled shareable score cards that appear on the VictoryScreen after level completion. Players can share their grade, accuracy, streak, and score to social media or clipboard.
- **`lib/share.ts`** — Pure utility module with `generateShareText()`, `canNativeShare()`, and `shareResults()`. Generates formatted share text with grade-specific emoji (👑 S, ⚡ A, 🔥 B, ✨ C, 💪 D, 🎮 F), streak callouts, and optional game URL.
- **`ShareCard` component** — Pixel-bordered score card with animated share button. Uses Web Share API on mobile (native share sheet) with clipboard fallback on desktop. Visual feedback for copy/share states via AnimatePresence transitions.
- **VictoryScreen integration** — New optional props: `gameName`, `streak`, `level`, `gameUrl`. When `gameName` is provided, the ShareCard renders below the action buttons.
- **8 new tests** (127→135 total) — `share.test.ts` covering: grade emoji mapping for all 6 ranks, streak inclusion/exclusion logic, URL appending, zero/100% accuracy edge cases, multi-line output structure.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Removed phantom Round Insights API reference** — README documented 5 functions from `lib/insights.ts` which does not exist. The entire Round Insights section was stale (likely planned but never implemented). Removed from both the API reference and Shared Game Systems list.
- **Corrected test count** — README claimed 153 tests; actual count is 127. Updated to match `vitest run` output.

### Added
- **Display Formatters API reference** — `formatTime()`, `renderSpeed()`, and `computeGrade()` from `lib/formatters.ts` now documented in README. These were extracted in v0.2.6 but never added to the API reference.
- **Curriculum Helpers API reference** — `getItemsByCategory()` and `getItemsByLevel()` from `data/curriculum.ts` now documented in README with usage context.
- **JSDoc for curriculum helpers** — Both `getItemsByCategory()` and `getItemsByLevel()` now have full JSDoc with `@param`, `@returns`, and `@example` tags for IDE autocomplete.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-23

### Security
- **Content ID validation for all public write functions** — `updateItemScore()`, `saveFSRSCard()`, `getRecallMultiplier()`, `completeLevel()`, `recordMasteryAttempt()`, and `checkMastery()` now validate their `itemId`/`levelKey`/`categoryId` parameters against a strict pattern (`/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.:/-]{1,128}$/`) and reject prototype pollution keys (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`). Previously, passing `"__proto__"` as an `itemId` to `updateItemScore()` could pollute `Object.prototype` via the scores object (CWE-1321, OWASP A03).
- **`checkMastery()` deserialization hardening** — Now validates parsed mastery data with `stripDangerousKeys()`, confirms top-level object shape, and validates each attempt entry has finite `accuracy` and `timestamp` fields. Previously trusted raw `JSON.parse()` output without any validation (CWE-502), while its sibling `recordMasteryAttempt()` was already properly hardened.
- **`completeLevel()` numeric clamping** — `levelId` parameter now clamped via `safeNumber()` to prevent NaN/Infinity propagation into the `completedLevels` array.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **26 new tests** (101→127 total) covering previously untested critical paths across 2 new test suites
- **`item-scoring.test.ts`** — 18 tests: `updateItemScore` isolation (new/existing items, accumulation, lastSeen updates, field preservation), `getItemsForReview` fallback sort order (oldest-seen first, excludes strong items, empty result when all mastered, FSRS priority over naive fallback), `getDueItems` edge cases (empty/future-due/limit), `getRecallMultiplier` exact boundary conditions (6.96d→1×, 7d→2×, 29d→2×, 30d→3×)
- **`enrichment-integration.test.ts`** — 8 tests: enrichment field integrity validation (required fields present, proTip optional but non-empty), enrichment-less items in difficulty analysis, `selectItems` oldest-seen prioritization (timestamp ordering, unseen-always-first guarantee), cross-module integration (storage→difficulty→selection promotion flow, confidence with mixed tiers, curriculum→difficulty engine compatibility)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **21 new tests** (80→101 total) targeting untested critical paths in the adaptive difficulty engine and curriculum helpers
- **`difficulty-edge-cases.test.ts`** — 16 tests covering: rolling window cap (only 5 most recent scores per tier), per-tier streak computation, `computeRecommendation` boundary conditions (exact 50%/85% thresholds, hard-only data with poor performance, missing tier data fallthrough), tier fallback ordering (medium→hard→easy reaches all tiers, easy/hard only reach adjacent), item exhaustion, deduplication, explicit profile bypass, orphaned score handling
- **`curriculum.test.ts`** — 5 tests covering: `getItemsByCategory` (valid/invalid), `getItemsByLevel` (valid/invalid), and curriculum data integrity (unique IDs, required fields, non-empty levels)

### Fixed
- Discovered and documented `buildTierOrder` behavior: easy-recommended players never see hard content (only adjacent tiers are searched), while medium-recommended players can access all three tiers. This is correct for a Kumon-style system but was previously undocumented.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Adaptive difficulty engine** (`lib/difficulty.ts`) — Kumon-style diagnostic placement that analyzes rolling accuracy per difficulty tier (easy/medium/hard). Promotes at 85% accuracy, demotes at 50%, with configurable window size. Outputs a `DifficultyProfile` with per-tier stats and confidence level (new/low/high).
- **`selectItems()` smart picker** — selects content at the recommended difficulty, prioritizing unseen items, falling back to adjacent tiers when the target tier is exhausted.
- **`useDifficulty` React hook** (`hooks/useDifficulty.ts`) — wraps the engine with reactive state. Auto-analyzes on mount, re-analyzes after each round via `refresh()`, supports manual override via `setDifficulty()`.
- **14 new tests** (66→80 total) — full coverage of the difficulty engine: tier promotion/demotion thresholds, confidence levels, per-tier accuracy computation, item selection with fallback, unseen-item prioritization, empty catalog handling.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **25 new tests** (41→66 total) covering previously untested critical paths
- **`formatters.test.ts`** — 19 tests for extracted display helpers: `formatTime` edge cases (NaN, negative, Infinity, fractional seconds, multi-hour), `renderSpeed` time-vs-rate detection (case-insensitive regex, boundary values), `computeGrade` threshold boundaries (exact grade cutoffs and sub-threshold transitions)
- **6 new storage edge-case tests** — JSON syntax error recovery, null progress recovery, Infinity multiplier fallback, zero-amount XP, invalid event type rejection, level+XP integration flow

### Changed
- **Extracted `formatTime`, `renderSpeed`, `computeGrade`** from `VictoryScreen.tsx` into `lib/formatters.ts` — pure functions are now independently testable without jsdom. VictoryScreen imports from the new module with zero behavior change.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **JSDoc for all 21 exported functions/interfaces in `storage.ts`** — Every public API now has parameter docs, return types, usage examples, and cross-references. Enables IDE tooltips and autocomplete for game developers.
- **JSDoc for all 3 React hooks** — `useProgress`, `useGameStats`, and `useSoundEffects` now document their purpose, parameters, and usage patterns.
- **API Reference section in README** — Complete table-format reference for the storage layer (setup, XP, FSRS, streaks, mastery, analytics) and React hooks. Developers can now onboard without reading implementation code.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-18

### Security
- **Storage layer: input validation and data integrity hardening** — All `JSON.parse()` calls from localStorage now pass through runtime validators that strip `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype` keys (prevents prototype pollution, CWE-502), clamp numeric fields to safe bounds (prevents NaN/Infinity propagation, CWE-20), and reject non-conforming shapes.
- **`configureStorage()`: game ID sanitization** — Rejects IDs with special characters, path traversal sequences, or excessive length (1-64 alphanumeric/hyphen/underscore only). Prevents localStorage key injection (OWASP A03).
- **`addXP()`: numeric bounds enforcement** — Amount clamped to 0–100,000 and multiplier to 0–10. Negative, NaN, and Infinity values safely rejected.
- **`recordMasteryAttempt()`: accuracy clamping** — Bounded to 0–100 with type validation on parsed mastery data.
- **`getFSRSCards()`: array element validation** — Parsed entries must have `itemId` (string), `due` (finite number), and `stability` (finite number). Malformed entries silently filtered.
- **`recordLearningEvent()`: event type whitelist** — Only the 5 defined event types are accepted; unknown types are silently dropped.

### Added
- 8 security-focused tests: prototype pollution defense, negative value clamping, corrupted localStorage recovery, malformed FSRS card rejection, game ID injection prevention (41 total, up from 33)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **VictoryScreen timer rendering** — Time-based speed values now render as `m:ss` format instead of raw seconds. Detects time-based metrics via `speedLabel` pattern matching (e.g., "Time", "Elapsed"). Guards against NaN, negative, and Infinity values from corrupted timer state, rendering "—" as fallback.
- **Timer division-by-zero** — `Timer` percentage bar now guards against `duration === 0` to prevent `NaN` width on the progress bar.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- **Storage layer: configurable game ID** — Replaced hardcoded `GAME_ID` constant with `configureStorage(id)` + `getGameId()` API. Games call `configureStorage("my_game")` once at init instead of editing source. All localStorage keys now derived dynamically via `storageKey()` helper.
- **Analytics: implemented stub metrics** — `averageTimeToMastery` now computed from `first_correct` → `concept_mastered` event timestamps per item. `retentionRate30Day` now computed from 30-day review events (was hardcoded to 0).
- **Removed dead code** — Removed unused `STREAK_FREEZE_KEY` constant (streak freezes are stored inside the progress object, never had a separate key).

### Added
- 4 new tests: `configureStorage` namespace isolation, `averageTimeToMastery` computation, `retentionRate30Day` computation (33 total, up from 29)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Vitest test suite** for `storage.ts` persistence layer (29 tests)
- Test coverage: XP system, recall multipliers, streak freezes, mastery gates, FSRS card CRUD, review queue fallback, learning analytics, reset
- Edge cases: multi-day streak gaps, freeze consumption, analytics event trimming, duplicate level completion guard

### Changed
- Added `test` script to `package.json`
- Added `vitest` as dev dependency

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Complete suite documentation: all 10 games with repo links, live URLs, and descriptions
- 4 tech fundamentals games added to README: API Architect, Netrunner, CyberShield, Circuit Prophet
- Per-game live deployment links for all 10 games
- Getting Started section for scaffolding new games from template

### Changed
- README rewritten from 6-game spec overview to full 10-game suite showcase
- License changed to MIT

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Streak freeze multi-day gap**: Streak freezes now calculate actual days missed instead of only checking "yesterday". Previously, missing 3 days with 1 freeze would still preserve the streak — now it correctly requires enough freezes to cover the full gap.
- **Recall multiplier first-time detection**: `getRecallMultiplier` no longer conflates "never seen" items with "seen but always answered wrong" items. Players who previously failed an item now correctly get recall bonuses when they return to it after 7/30 days.
- **Timer onTimeUp called during render**: Moved `onTimeUp` callback out of `setState` updater using `queueMicrotask` and a ref pattern to prevent stale closures and state updates during React's render phase.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-02-20

### Added
- Master specification with 6 game designs
- Shared game template (Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 + TypeScript)
- Persistence layer with localStorage (SSR-safe)
- XP system with delayed recall rewards
- Streak system with freeze mechanic
- FSRS-4.5 spaced repetition integration
- Mastery gate system
- Learning analytics tracking
- Sound effects via Web Audio API
- Retro UI components (Button, XPBar, StreakBadge, Timer, VictoryScreen)
